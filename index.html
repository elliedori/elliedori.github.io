<h1>Ayurveda</h1>
<h2>The Science of Living</h2>

<p>Ayurveda is the ancient Indian system of healing and well-being. Ayurveda states that balance is the key to a healthy body, mind, and spirit. That balance can be found first by evaluating a person's dosha, or disposition, and then introducing balance through foods, exercises, and practices that temper what's excessive and encourage what's subdued. Although it's best to be examined by an Ayurvedic doctor to determine your dispostion, you can make an educated assumption by evaluating yourself. Most people are a mix of two dosha, with one being more dominant than the other.</p>
